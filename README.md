## About

I began this monster over 4 years ago while in school ('round about 2010). My instructors offered a good deal of encouragement and advice and it's largely because of their faith in me that I was able to take this as far as I have.

After years of languishing in some onbscure sector of my harddrive, I have chosen to release this work to the public, free of charge and with no strings attached. I ask only this of anyone that might find this tome useful. Please drop me an email and let me know what you enjoyed about this work, or if you didn't care much for it, let me know that too. Although I hope you will be kind in your remarks as this was a true labor of love for me.


### Here's a little intro if you're interested:

From the power of combinators to the remarkable agility of responsive design, advanced typography snippets, mind-bending selectors, an exhaustive study of gradients, shadows, and rounded corners to incredible poly-geometric animations, CSS is used to sculpt visual web* experiences the world over.
